Under the label of "decentralized science", several communities are exploring the use of blockchains and related cryptographic technology for structuring scientific research. One focus is on funding, using ideas from crypto-currencies. Another focus is publication with better provenance tracking.

While I am optimistic about the long-time potential of these efforts, I don't expect any real progress to be made as long as these communities remain attached to blockchains and their crypto-currencies. A big practical issue with blockchains is that they are, by design, largely decoupled from the real world. The interface between people, institutions, and blockchains are anonymous accounts, of which each actor can create an arbitrary number. Anonymity and cheap accounts means that nothing prevents people from reviewing their own publications, using a second account, or voting multiple times on some issue. Anonymity also means that actions on the blockchain are unrelated to a person's scientific reputation.
