There are various ongoing attempts to create supporting technology for making simple software that empowers individuals and small groups. To the best of my knowledge, there are no commercial activities in this sector. All of the projects I am aware of are made by people scratching their own itches. As a consequence, they are small projects by small communities, not very visible.

None of the projects I am aware of is about research software. Moreover, many of them take an extremist position on some aspect, which may well be incompatible with the needs of research software. I am not discussing these projects here because I think scientists should adopt them. I see them as (1) proof that simplicity in software is possible if you make it a high enough priority and (2) a source of ideas for how to design simple software. The only discussion of related issue in the context of academic research that I am aware of is [an issue of "digital humanities quarterly" dedicated to "Minimal Computing"](http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/index.html).

The following alphabetically ordered list makes no claim to being exhaustive. It contains projects that I discovered, sometimes by sheer luck, and which looked interesting enough to spend a few hours investigating them. If you know of any other project I should look into, please let me know (ideally in public, [on Mastodon]((https://scholar.social/@khinsen)).

[Freewheeling apps](https://akkartik.name/freewheeling/) is a small software stack for personal and easy-to-change applications with graphical user interfaces that are portable across devices and platforms. It is built on top of [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), a game development framework for the programming language [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). There are [a few examples](https://akkartik.itch.io/) to get started. Lua is an interesting project in its own right from the simplicity point of view, because in spite of being 30 years old (just two years younger than Python), and used in various application domains, it has largely escaped the fate of creeping complexification.

[Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) is a minimalist Web-like technology stack, replacing both the HTTP protocol and the HTML markup language by much simpler equivalents. The goal of Gemini is twofold: create a simple technology stack that is easy to implement, and eliminate features seen as undesirable by its community, such as tracking or advertising, by making them technically impossible.

The programming language [Hare](https://harelang.org/), currently in an early stage of development, has the design goals to be simple, stable, and robust. Its plan for avoiding complexification is radical: once the specification reaches version 1.0, it will be frozen forever. The stated goal is to become [a 100-year programming language](https://harelang.org/blog/2023-11-08-100-year-language/).

The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) is a community dedicated to simple Web sites based on simple standards and simple technology, outside of corporate control. It provides support for people wishing to build and host their own Web sites, using a manageable subset of the official Web standards complemented by conventions such as [microformat](https://indieweb.org/microformats).

[KolibriOS](https://kolibrios.org/en/) is an operating system for old and/or low-resource computers. It does not seem to have an explicit focus on simplicity, but requires such a focus indirectly though resource restrictions.

[Minimacy](https://minimacy.net/) is a small functional programming language, resembling [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) with its own virtual machine and standard library. It runs inside a host operating system, but is meant to be usable without any operating system in the long run. The goal is to have a technology stack that a single software engineer can understand in its entirety, and build applications on top of it without fearing bad surprises such as [software collapse](Software%20collapse.md) or security issues.

[Smalltalk 80](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/273) is the last iteration of a programming system designed in the 1970s and 1980 at Xerox' Palo Alto Research Center. Its [design principles](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html) include the goal of "personal mastery", a system being entirely comprehensible to a single individual. Several descendants, such as [Squeak](https://squeak.org/) and [Pharo](https://pharo.org/), are still actively developed and used, but only [Cuis](https://cuis.st/) has maintained the focus on simplicity.

[Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) is a small and highly portable virtual machine, supporting graphical user interfaces and designed to be programmed in its own low-level language, [uxntal](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html). It is inspired by the [permacomputing movement](https://permacomputing.net/), which aims at reducing the material and energy footprint of computing technology. The constraints that uxn places on program size and working memory enfore simplicity as a byproduct.
