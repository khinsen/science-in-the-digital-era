In the context of [computer-aided research](Computer-aided%20research.md), reproducibility refers to the possibility to re-execute a computation and check that the results are identical. It differs from [computational replicability](Computational%20replicability.md), which is about the robustness of results under minor changes in the software. Unfortunately, terminology hasn't settled yet and some authors use these two terms in exactly the opposite way.

Computational reproducibility became a subject of debate because its practical impossibility came as a surprise. Computations are supposed to be deterministic. 2 + 2 is 4 today, as it has been for centuries, and we have little doubt that the result will be the same 100 years from now. Computations done by a computer usually perform a huge number of such steps, but that shouldn't make a difference: 1 million deterministic steps still make for a deterministic result. The practical experience of scientists using computers is quite the opposite: it is the rule rather than the exception that re-running someone else's computation leads to a slightly different result.

This apparent mystery has a simple explanation. If you re-do a computation twice in succession on your computer, you will get the same answer (ignoring special cases such as random number generators or parallel computing). If you re-do a computation a day later on the same computer, you will also get the same answer, most of the time. In fact, if you get a different result, then something has changed on your computer in between. Most probably, you have updated some software, possibly without being aware of it. And when you re-do someone else's computation on your computer, you are actually transferring a small component of one software system into a different software environment - yours. In other words, when a reproduction attempt for a computation yields a different result, the by far most frequent explanation is that the computations were subtly different.

So how can it happen that two people who are convinced of doing the same computation are actually doing different ones? The two main culprits are the complexity and the opacity of today's software stacks. What you think of as "the software" you are running is really just the tip of the iceberg. Between that code and the processor that is doing the work inside your computer, there are many layers of software that have an impact on the results you will get. Obtaining a full description of those layers is very difficult to impossible on most of today's computing platforms. Transferring all of them to another machine is even more difficult, and often impossible.

## A case study

An interesting case study from chemistry was [published in 2019 by Neupane *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b03216). It starts from a [2014 publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2014.042) of a computational protocol for obtaining molecular structures from chemical shifts measured by NMR (don't worry if you don't understand what this means). The supplementary material for that publication contains two Python scripts that are essential parts of the protocol. What Neupane *et al.* discovered is that these scripts access the data files they process in a way that tacitly assumes a behavior specific to the Windows operating system. When run under Linux, the scripts can read the data files in a wrong order, depending on circumstances that are outside of the scripts' control. As Neupane *et al.* note:

Yes, your operating system is part of the software that you are running. As are, in the case of this specific example, the Python interpreter, the Python libraries it depends on, and a much larger number of nearly invisible libraries that Python itself depends on. All of these software components are regularly updated by their authors, with the goal of fixing bugs, adding features, or improving performance. This explains why the software environment on your computer changes all the time, and why two different computers are highly unlikely to have the same software environment.

The two Python scripts that are the focus of this case study have been fixed in the meantime, but I suspect that many scientists still have and use the original ones.

## Is there a way out?

Yes. Computational reproducibility is, in principle, a solved problem. There are well-understood techniques to document a software assembly completely and precisely, in such a way that it can be transferred to a different computer. Not just any computer though, it has to be sufficiently similar to the original one, and in particular use the same type of processor (which, in a way, is also part of your software stack). Better yet, there are freely available tools that manage software reproducibly for you: [Nix](Nix.md) and [Guix](Guix.md).

This isn't the end of the story though. The existence of support tools that guarantee computational reproducibility is only the first step. In terms of user-friendliness, these tools still leave a lot to be desired. And most research software has not yet been integrated into their management scheme, and for some software this is nearly impossible. In particular, only [Open Source](Open%20Source.md) software can be managed reproducibly, because controlled compilation of the source code is a crucial step. And that also means that the only operating system that can be supported is [Linux](Linux.md).

A few years ago, a frequently discussed question was "is computational reproducibility possible?". Today it is clear that the answer is "yes". Now the question is how much reproducibility is worth to researchers. Enough to support the development of Nix and Guix? Enough to invest into learning how to use them? Enough to abandon proprietary software, including the popular operating systems Windows and macOS? Time will tell. Computational reproducibility is no longer a technical issue, it's a social one.
