There are many ongoing attempts to create supporting technology for making simple software that empowers individuals and small groups. Almost by definition, these are small projects by small communities, and therefore not very visible. None of the projects I am aware of is about research software, but their ideas could very well be transposed to that domain.

For some of these projects, code simplicity is the immediate objective. Others are motivated by reducing the impact of computing on the physical environment, i.e. reducing the consumption of energy or raw naterials. The [permacomputing movement](https://permacomputing.net/) takes this to the extreme. Yet others want to escape the clutches of the dominating corporations (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) that control most of today's means of computation. 

Here is a list of some projects in this space that I have looked into more than superficially:
 - [DuskOS](https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/item/README.md) is a simple operating system designed to permit the continued use of old computing hardware after civilizational collapse
 - [Freewheeling apps](https://akkartik.name/freewheeling/) is a small software stack for personal and easy-to-change applications.
 - [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) is a minimalist Web-like technology stack (replacing the HTTP protocol and the HTML markup language) designed to facilitate the implementation of servers and clients and to make bloated sites impossible by construction.
 - [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) is a community dedicated to simple Web sites based on simple standards and simple technology.
 - [Minimacy](https://minimacy.net/) is a small programming language with its own virtual machine and standard library, designed to support the development of custom software by small teams.
 - [Smalltalk](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html) is a programming system whose initial design goals in the 1970s included "personal mastery": being entirely comprehensible to a single individual. [Cuis](https://cuis.st/) is its only modern descendant that has maintained this focus on simplicity.
 - [Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) is a small and highly portable virtual machine designed to be programmed in its own low-level language uxntal.
 - [Weblite](https://codeberg.org/Weblite) is a set of specifications for simplified versions of HTML, CSS, and XML, but less radical than Gemini.

Disclaimer: I have not actively used any of these projects, so I cannot say to what degree they achieve their stated goals.
