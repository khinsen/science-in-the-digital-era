What characterizes [formal systems](Formal%20system.md) (as well as formal [languages](Formal%20language.md), methods, etc.) is the existence of a closed symbolic universe in which precise rules apply. Formal systems require no reference to a context for interpreting their rules or making judgments of any kind. The symbols that are processed by a formal systems are of course interpreted in some application context, but this happens outside of the formal universe.

Informal methods, in contrast, use less precise references and rules, whose exact interpretation is context-dependent. The words of a (human) language are a good example. They usually take different meanings in different contexts, but those meanings are nevertheless somehow related.

[Scientific models](Scientific%20model.md) are inherently context-dependent and therefore informal. Formal systems are tools for reasoning that are always embedded into a larger informal model that links the formal system's symbols to concepts about the physical world.
