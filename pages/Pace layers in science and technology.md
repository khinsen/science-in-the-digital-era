The concept of pace layers has been introduced by Stewart Brand in 1999. If you haven't read his article [Pace Layering: How Complex Systems Learn and Keep Learning](https://doi.org/10.21428/7f2e5f08), do so right now (it's not very long) and then come back here.

The pace layers of human civilization that Stewart Brand identifies are, from fast to slow:
 - Fashion/art
 - Commerce
 - Infrastructure
 - Governance
 - Culture
 - Nature

Brand puts science into the infrastructure layer. Quote:

    Education is intellectual infrastructure. So is science.
    They have very high yield, but delayed payback.
    Hasty societies that can't span those delays will
    lose out over time to societies that can. On the
    other hand, cultures too hidebound to allow education
    to advance at infrastructural pace also lose out.

From the bird's-eye perspective of human civilization, infrastructure is clearly the appropriate layer for science. But we can also zoom in on science and technology, the two being closely intertwined, and identify pace layers in the advancement of this particular aspect of human civilization.

The fastest layer is *observation* (science) and *tinkering* (technology). Being curious about one's environment, without any long-term plans in mind. Playing with ideas, watching what happens. [Moving fast and breaking things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_fast_and_break_things). 

Next comes *empirical research*, which consists of formulating hypotheses based on observations, and then testing them on new observations obtained from experiments, which are designed specifically for testing a hypothesis. On the technological side, we have the *design and fabrication of artifacts* for a specific purpose.

The design and refinement of *[models](Scientific%20model.md)* occupies the next layer in science. Models are more general than hypotheses, requiring a wider range of observational input and a wider range of experiments for testing. In technology, the corresponding layer is about *techniques* for designing and fabricating artifacts.

The fourth pace layer of science contains *theories* and *paradigms*. Paradigms define the phenomena that a discipline considers relevant, and the methods used to study them. Theories are the consolidated foundation of research based on a paradigm. Examples are quantum mechanics in physics, and evolution in biology. The technology analogue is, unfortunately, called *technology* as well. Examples from the discipline of electrical engineering are electric generators and integrated circuits.

The slowest pace layer contains *disciplines* in both science and engineering. In the bigger picture of human civilization, they are part of the governance layer. Disciplines are about the values of a community. What is good science? What is relevant science? Different disciplines have different answers. These values matter more than the original domain of study of a discipline. Consider physics, which has evolved to include social phenomena into its domain of interest, as for example in [econophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econophysics). On the other hand, many molecular phenomena are chemistry, and thus outside of physics, because they are described in terms of patterns rather than numbers. What really defines physics is the focus on mathematical models and quantified observations.

In the [digital era](Science%20in%20the%20digital%20era), the technology dominating much of scientific progress is computing. Computing technology has the same pace layers as other technologies, but they all move faster than for the older branches of engineering. This makes it challenging to use computing technology in the slower pace layers of science. For example, techniques for implementing [scientific models](Scientific%20model.md) should be stable at the time scale of evolution of scientific models, which is several decades. While there is computing technology that is sufficiently stable (Fortran, Unix, HTML, ...), it is not particularly well suited for representing scientific models.
