Many scientists today find themselves depending on computational tools that they do not fully understand and that they are unable to modify to fit their needs. Their research is thus constrained by their software tools, and sometimes that constraint only leaves the choice of doing research badly or not at all.

The paper [Between Scripts and Applications: Computational Media for the Frontier of Nanoscience.md](Between%20Scripts%20and%20Applications.%20Computational%20Media%20for%20the%20Frontier%20of%20Nanoscience.md) describes this situation with the very fitting term "computational disempowerment", which I am happy to borrow here.

My current view of a way out of this situation consists of two major ingredients:

 1. The introduction and use of [computational media](Computational%20media.md) as the main human-computer interface in science.

 2. The creation of a [digital infrastructure](Digital%20infrastructure.md) for science, consisting of software components and services that are designed, developed, and maintained explicitly for scientific research, with appropriate governance mechanisms.
