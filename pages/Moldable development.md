Quoting the [Moldable Development Web site](https://moldabledevelopment.com/):

> Moldable development is a way of programming through which you
> construct custom tools for each problem.

This implies erasing the boundary between development tools and code under development. Instead of writing a piece of software to perform some task, you extend a software environment by tools for working in some problem domain. The added tools do not just perform tasks, but also provide feedback and insight concerning the problem domain to the user of the software system.

In [computational science](Computational%20science.md), this is a big step towards shifting the focus from tools and tasks to problems, models, and methods, something I have been [advocating since 2015](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.3978.2).

Today's reference environment in supporting moldable development is the [Glamorous Toolkit](Glamorous%20Toolkit.md), which is based on [Pharo](Pharo.md) but also supports other languages to varying degrees.
