A digital garden is a small ecosystem of interrelated documents that its curator tends to with regular updates and revisions. It differs from a blog, which is a stream of finished-then-published documents. A digital garden can be considered a special case of a Wiki that is curated by a single person or a small team, in contrast to open-to-all collaborative works such as Wikipedia.
