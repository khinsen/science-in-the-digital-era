A scientific notation is a convention for encoding scientific information using symbols. The best known example is mathematical notation. The goal of a scientific notation is to represent scientific knowledge in a way that humans can easily comprehend and manipulate. While in principle a mathematical equation could be replaced by an equivalent statement in plain language, the more concise equation is faster to read (assuming a trained reader) and allows manipulation by formal rules (such as "add the same term to both sides").

A *digital* scientific notation is a scientific notation that can be processed by both humans and computers. A machine readable notation is necessarily a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) and thus has a well-defined unambiguous syntax in addition to some useful level of well-defined semantics.

There are many formal languages designed for representing scientific information. An example is the [Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBML). Most of them do not qualify as digital scientific notations, because they are designed to be used by software but not for communication between humans.

There are also human-readable formal languages designed primarily for non-scientific applications but also used to represent scientific information. Programming languages used in [scientific computing](Scientific%20computing.md) are the most prominent examples. In [computational notebooks](Computational%20notebooks.md), high-level programming languages such as Python or R are routinely used as a scientific notation. However, they fill this role rather poorly, in particular because they cannot express anything other than executable algorithms.
