Why do scientists publish their work? Leaving aside the incentives of today's publish-or-perish culture, they do so to enable their peers (and sometimes others) to learn about and engage with their work. It's worth to take a closer look at this, because it matters for the [Open Science](Open%20Science.md) movement's efforts of publishing more than papers, in particular data and code.

Readers of a scientific paper can adopt one of the four following levels of engagement:

1. **Take note** of the work. Read the abstract, take a look at the figures and their captions, read the introduction and conclusions. If it looks potentially relevant for their own work, file it away, mentally, electronically, or physically.

2. **Understand** in detail the scientific questions asked, the hypotheses made, the methods and tools applied, the data obtained and/or processed, and the conclusions drawn.

3. **Judge** the well-foundedness of the hypotheses, the adequacy of the methods and tools, the quality of execution, and the validity of the conclusions.

4. **Make their own** the ideas, the methods and tools, and the data, in view of basing their own future work on them.

These four levels of engagement can only happen in the order cited. You cannot judge something that you do not understand, nor make your own something you are unable to judge. Increasing engagement requires increasing levels of competence and experience, and of course a more and more serious investment of time.

When it comes to data or code, a frequently stated goal for Open Science is "reuse", the R in the [FAIR principles](FAIR.md). It corresponds to the highest level of engagement. You have make the data or code your own if you want to reuse it, because you are responsible for ensuring that they are adequate for the purposes of your own research project. Reusing a dataset or a piece of scientific software is very different from reusing yesterday's dishes after washing them. Scientific data and code are not commodities. They are highly context-dependent. Responsible reuse requires understanding both the original and the new context.

It then follows that reuse is possible only if the data and code is published with sufficient documentation to permit understanding and judging them. This is particularly difficult for code. A popular quote from the preface of the famous textbook [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) says that “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Unfortunately, this is not today's reality. At best, software developers make an effort to keep their code readable for themselves and their peers, but not for their users. This is the main motivation behind my research project on [Digital Scientific Notations](Digital%20scientific%20notation.md).
