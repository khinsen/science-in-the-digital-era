My name is [Konrad Hinsen](https://khinsen.net/), and I have been a research scientist at [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) in France since 1998.

My scientific career started in statistical physics, with a [thesis on colloidal suspensions](https://de.book-info.com/isbn/3-86073-050-9.htm) at [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/) in Germany. My thesis was based mostly on computer simulations that ran on the [Cray Y-MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_Y-MP) at the [Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich](http://www.fz-juelich.de/). The simulation programs were small Fortran codes that I wrote and tested myself.

After my thesis I moved to computational biophysics, applying various simulation techniques to proteins and (to a much lesser degree) DNA. I fell into a different universe, one where most researchers are users of a small number of simulation packages written by an equally small number of groups. As a consequence, most scientists cannot inspect in detail, let alone modify, the models and methods they apply in their research. While this situation is understandable in its historical context (the models for biomolecules are complex and the size of the simulated systems requires optimized code), I consider it unacceptable in the long run. Models and methods are at the heart of science and we should never allow them to be obfuscated or hidden.

This experience, together with my first encounter with [computational (ir)reproducibility](Computational%20reproducibility.md) around the same time (1995), was the starting point for my second topic of research: the methodology of [computational science](Computational%20science.md), or, as I prefer to frame it nowadays, [computer-aided research](Computer-aided%20research.md).

My first idea was to make scientific software more accessible through the use of high-level languages, and after I discovered the [Python](Python.md) language, I ended up becoming a founding member of the [Matrix-SIG](https://www.python.org/community/sigs/retired/matrix-sig/), which developed Numerical Python, the predecessor of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). On that basis I then developed the [Molecular Modelling Toolkit](https://github.com/khinsen/MMTK). In contrast to the popular simulation packages of the time (1997), it was not a program with a fixed feature set, but a toolkit of basic algorithms that researchers could use from their own Python scripts.

The move from Fortran to Python did indeed lower the entrance barrier to becoming a developer, but still most biophysicists did not want to become developers, and, more importantly, models and methods were still hidden in computer code that had to respect constraints related to efficient executability. It takes less time to find and read the relevant code section in MMTK than in older software, but scientists still cannot study and work with their models directly. And then, the lower entrance barrier of Python completely changed to way scientists write and use software, with one big negative impact being the fragility of the scientific Python ecosystem. Whereas the Fortran code of my thesis still compiles and runs, many of my Python scripts of ten years ago have become hard to use, and even harder to trust. [Reproducibility](Computational%20reproducibility.md) has become a major challenge, not only in the Python ecosystem.

The approaches I am currently exploring for giving scientists more control over their models and methods are [digital scientific notations](Digital%20scientific%20notation.md) and [re-editable software](Reusable%20vs.%20re-editable%20components.md), within the larger goal of creating [computational media](Computational%20media.md) for science. I am also closely following research on similarly-minded topics, such as explainability in machine learning and human-computer interaction. As Richard Hamming famously said, [the purpose of computing is insight, not numbers](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/richard_hamming_645682). There is no point in performing massive computations if nobody knows if their results can be trusted or how they can be interpreted scientifically.
