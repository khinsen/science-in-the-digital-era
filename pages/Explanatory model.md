In contrast to [empirical models](Empirical%20model.md), explanatory models describe the underlying mechanisms that determine the values of observed quantities, rather than extrapolating the quantities themselves. They describe the systems being studied at a more fundamental level, allowing for a wide range of generalizations.

A simple explanatory model is given by the [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations), also called predator-prey equations. This is a model for the time evolution of the populations of two species in a preditor-prey relation. An example is shown in this plot (Lamiot, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons):

An empirical model would capture the oscillations of the two curves and their correlations, for example by describing the populations as superpositions of sine waves. The Lotka-Volterra equations instead describe the interactions between the population numbers: predators and prey are born and die, but in addition predators eat prey, which reduces the number of prey in proportion to the number of predators, and contributes to a future increase in the number of predators because they can better feed their young. With that type of description, one can ask what-if questions: What if hunters shoot lots of predators? What if prey are hit by a famine, i.e. a decrease in their own source of food? In fact, the significant deviations from regular periodic change in the above plot suggests that such influences from the environment (everything not explicitly represented in the model) are quite important in practice.

One of the biggest success stories in the history of science is the shift from the empirical models for celestial mechanics (Ptolemy's geocentric epicycles, Kepler's heliocentric ellipses) to Issac Newton's explanatory differential equations. Newton's laws of motion and gravitation fully explained Kepler's elliptical orbits and improved on them. More importantly, they showed that the fundamental laws of physics are the same on Earth and in space, a fact that may seem obvious to us today but wasn't in the 17th century. Finally, Newton's laws have permitted the elaboration of a rich theory, today called "classical mechanics", that provides several alternative forms of the basic equations (in particular [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) and [Hamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics) mechanics), plus derived principles such as the conservation of energy. As for what-if questions, Newton's laws have made it possible to send artefacts to the moon and to the other planets of the solar system, something which would have been unimaginable on the basis of Ptolemy's epicycles.

In the past, almost all explanatory models took the form of mathematical equations, and in particular differential equations. This is likely to change in the digital era. [Agent-based models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) are an example of "digital native" explanatory models. There is, however, a formal characteristic that is shared by all explanatory models that I am aware of, and that distinguishes them from empirical models: they take the form of [specifications](Specification.md).
