An [article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376287) (also available as a free [preprint](https://pure.au.dk/ws/files/177499843/iNano_CHI_2020.pdf)) that describes  common problems with today's state of the art in  [computer-aided research](Computer-aided%20research.md), and proposes a solution via the introduction of [computational media](Computational%20media.md).

The article describes a study of how a team working in experimental biomolecular nanoscience uses computational tools in their daily work. The computational environment of this team is quite typical for the natural sciences today:

 - multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, ...)
 - black-box applications that provide a rigid set of well-known functionality
 - badly documented scripts that were written by researchers for a specific project, with no intention of maintenance
 - dependencies of those scripts (that nobody could even list exhaustively)

This situation creates [computational disempowerment](Computational%20disempowerment.md), as scientists cannot work safely and productively with this mess, but they cannot work at all without it.

The authors report on the experimental introduction of a [computational medium](Computational%20media.md) ([Webstrates](Webstrates.md)) into the workflow of this research team.
