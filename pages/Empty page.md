There are many empty pages in this collection, and you may wonder why.

One reason is that this [digital garden](Digital%20garden.md) is work in progress. When I work on a page, I often insert links to pages that I intend to write, but haven't written yet. So you see an empty page. If you come back later, you may find some real content there. So... come back often.

The second reason is that empty pages are useful link targets, due to the backlink feature in my digital garden. At the end of each page, you see a list of other pages that link to the current one. Empty pages thus fulfill the role of a subject index in a traditional book: they help you find where some topic is discussed.
