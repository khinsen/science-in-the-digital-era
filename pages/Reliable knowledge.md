"Reliable knowledge" is the first part of the title of a book by [John Ziman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ziman), a physicist whose interest later shifted to the philosophy of science. It's an excellent book, whose full title is "[Reliable Knowledge: An Exploration of the Grounds for Belief in Science](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/general-science/popular-science/reliable-knowledge-exploration-grounds-belief-science?format=PB)". I am less enthusiastic about the term "belief in science", which I prefer to replace by "[trust](Building%20a%20Web%20of%20Trust%20for%20Open%20Science.md) in science", but that's minor quibble.

I see "reliable knowledge" as the best term to summarize the goal of scientific research, which is why it got a page of its own in my digital garden. It also describes the two directions in which scientific knowledge advances: more knowledge, and increased reliability for existing knowledge. The [reproducibility crisis](Reproducibility%20crisis.md) has shown the importance of the second direction, which we have collectively neglected during several decades of emphasizing novelty as the main criterion for judging scientific publications.
