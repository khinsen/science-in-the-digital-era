- If you come here from time to time to check for new material, see the list of [recently changed pages](#$:/core/ui/SideBar/Recent).

### Citing pages from this site

At the end of each page, there is a permanent link to the exact version of the text you have been reading. This is the preferred reference for citations in other work. For sharing on social media, use the link shown by your browser, which always refers to the latest version.

There is also an archival version of the permanent link, which refers to the [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) archive and may not work yet when you see it. If you are interested in the technicalities, see [the detailed explanation](Links%20to%20the%20future.md)!
