This [digital garden](Digital%20Garden.md) contains essays, thoughts, random ideas, and references that relate to the practice of scientific research in the digital era, characterized by computers (personal, high-performance, cloud, ...), software, the Internet, global collaborations, social networks, and more. They represent exclusively [my personal views](About%20the%20author.md) and in particular not those of [my employer](https://www.cnrs.fr/).

### How to use this site

- Via the search bar on the top right, you can search the full text of everything.
- Light blue links point to pages inside the digital garden. Dark blue and underlined links are external.
- If an internal link leads to an [empty page](Empty%20page.md), come back later to see what I have to say on that topic.
- If you come here from time to time to check for new material, see the list of [recently changed pages](#$:/core/ui/SideBar/Recent).

### Citing pages from this site

At the end of each page, there is a permanent link to the exact version of the text you have been reading. This is the preferred reference for citations in other work. For sharing on social media, use the link shown by your browser, which always refers to the latest version.

There is also an archival version of the permanent link, which refers to the [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) archive. If GitHub ever closes down, or if my repository is deleted for whatever reason, the archival copy should still be there. Note however that it may not yet be there when you see it, because Software Heritage only scans GitHub from time to time.
