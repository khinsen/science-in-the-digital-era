The sustainability of research software has attracted much attention over the last decade. This is the consequence of software being an essential tool for almost any form of research today. Like other research tools, e.g. scientific instruments, software requires constant attention and effort to ensure that it continues to play its role in evolving [scientific and technological environments](The%20three%20environments%20of%20scientific%20software.md). I won't go into the details of the various challenges involved, as there is a growing literature you can easily find. A good starting point is [this 2016 report of The Knowledge Exchange](https://www.knowledge-exchange.info/event/software-sustainability).

Outside of scientific research, sustainability is also an increasingly common keyword. There are ongoing discussions on the sustainability of the global economy, but also more focused discussions on particular aspects of the economy, such as agriculture or specific branches of industry. However, there is an important difference: whereas the sustainablity discussion concerning research software is about ensuring *sufficient* resources, the sustainability discussion concerning the economy is about an *excessive use* of resources that is damaging the environment in which economic activity (and life!) takes place.

Economist Kate Raworth has come up with a stunningly simple visual image of sustainability: the [doughnut economy](https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/), along with the equally stunningly simple insight that "A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow."
